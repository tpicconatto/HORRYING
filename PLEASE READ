We have created a game entitled Horrying 
First users select a level 1-5, with each level including one more planet
Users then control a space ship either using the arrow keys or WASD
A user wins once they have scored 5 points
A user can score a point by colliding with the other player at a faster velocity than the other player
A user can score a point if the other player collides with a planet
Once five points is reached will display the winner and allow the user to pick another level
